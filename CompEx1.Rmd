# Problem 1 - Core concepts in statistical learning [2 points]

## a) Training and test MSE [1 point]
Here you write your smart answer. You may write latex $Y=f(x)+\varepsilon$.

Items with

* item1
* item2

## b) Bias-variance trade-off [1 point]

* Explain how that is done. Hint: this is what the $M$ repeated training data sets are used for. 
* Focus on Figure 4. As the flexibility of the model increases ($K$ decreases), what happens with
    + the squared bias,  
    + the variance, and  
    + the irreducible error?
* What would you recommend is the optimal value of $K$? Is this in agreement with what you found in a)?

# Problem 2 - Linear regression [4 points]

Here you see an R chunk that is evaluated (when knitting) and code is displayed.

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
data = read.table("https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/TMA4268/2018v/data/SYSBPreg3uid.txt")
dim(data)
colnames(data)
modelA=lm(-1/sqrt(SYSBP) ~ .,data = data)
summary(modelA)
```

## a) Understanding model output [1 point]
## b) Model fit [1 point]
## c) Confidence interval and hypothesis test [1 points]
## d) Prediction [1 point]
